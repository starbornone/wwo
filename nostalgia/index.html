    <p>Companies use nostalgia in marketing to bring back warm and familiar feelings. They rely on our fond memories to
      create products and experiences that remind us of simpler times. Advertisements often use retro styles and
      childhood icons to tempt us to buy not just products, but also the emotions connected to those memories. This way,
      nostalgia becomes a way to encourage consumption by making us believe that buying nostalgic items will bring back
      the happiness we felt in the past.</p>

    <p>Nostalgia can also serve as a distraction from the realities of our present, urging us to
      seek comfort in consumption rather than addressing the underlying issues we face today. We should critically
      engage with our nostalgia, understanding that while it can provide a fleeting sense of joy, it also reflects how
      our world is constantly evolving.</p>

    <p>Any hope for a better world relies upon our awareness and participation in our current one.</p>
