      <p>Remember Longcat, Jane? I remember Longcat. Fuck the picture on this page, I want to talk about Longcat.
        Memes were simpler back then, in 2006. They stood for something. And that something was nothing. Memes just
        <em>were</em>. “Longcat is long.” An undeniably true, self-reflexive statement. Water is wet, fire is hot,
        Longcat is long. Memes were floating signifiers without signifieds, meaningful in their meaninglessness.
        Nobody made memes, they just arose through spontaneous generation; Athena being birthed, fully formed,
        from her own skull.
      </p>

      <p>You could talk about them around the proverbial water cooler, taking comfort in their absurdity.
        “Hey, Johnston, have you seen the picture of that cat? They call it Longcat because it’s long!”
        “Ha ha, sounds like good fun, Stevenson! That reminds me, I need to show you this webpage I found the other
        day; it contains numerous animated dancing hamsters. It’s called—you’ll never believe this—hamsterdance!”
        And then Johnston and Stevenson went on to have a wonderful friendship based on the comfortable banality of
        self-evident digitized animals.</p>

      <p>But then 2007 came, and along with it came I Can Has, and everything was forever ruined. It was hubris,
        Jane. We did it to ourselves. The minute we added written language, it all went to shit. Suddenly memes had
        an excess of information to be parsed. It wasn’t just a picture of a cat, perhaps with a simple description
        appended to it; now the cat spoke to us via a written caption on the picture itself. It referred to an item
        of food that existed in our world but not in the world of the meme, rupturing the boundary between the two.
        The cat <em>wanted</em> something. Which forced us to recognize that what it wanted was us, was our
        attention. WE are the cheezburger, Jane, and we always were. But by the time we realized this, it was too
        late. We were slaves to the very memes that we had created. We toiled to earn the privilege of being
        distracted by them. They fiddled while Rome burned, and we threw ourselves into the fire so that we might
        listen to the music. The memes had us. Or, rather, they could has us.</p>

      <p>And it just got worse from there. Soon the cats had invisible bicycles and played keyboards. They gained
        complex identities, and so we hollowed out our own identities to accommodate them. We prayed to return to
        the simple days when we would admire a cat for its exceptional length alone, the days when the cat itself
        was the meme and not merely a vehicle for the complex memetic text. And the fact that this text was so
        sparse, informal, and broken ironically made it even more demanding. The intentional grammatical and
        syntactical flaws drew attention to themselves, making the meme even more about the captioning words and
        less about the pictures. Words, words, words. Wurds werds wordz. Stumbling through a crooked, dead-end
        hallway of a mangled clause describing a simple feline sentiment was a torture that we inflicted on
        ourselves daily. Let’s not forget where the word “caption” itself comes from: capio, Latin for both
        “I understand” and “I capture.” We thought that by captioning the memes, we were understanding them.
        Instead, our captions allowed them to capture us. The memes that had once been a cure for our cultural ills
        were now the illness itself.</p>

      <p>It goes right back to <em>Phaedrus</em>, really. The Plato dialogue. (You read that, right?) Back in the
        innocent days of 2006, we naïvely thought that the grapheme had subjugated the phoneme, that the belief in
        the primacy of the spoken word was an ancient and backwards folly on par with burning witches or practicing
        phrenology or thinking that Smash Mouth was good. Fucking <em>Smash Mouth</em>. But we were wrong. About
        the phoneme, I mean. The trickster god Theuth came to us again, this time in the guise of a grinning grey
        cat. The cat hungered, and so did Theuth. We’d already taken writing from him, so this time he offered us a
        new choice disguised as a gift. And we greedily took it, again oblivious to the consequences. To borrow the
        parlance of a contemporary meme, he made us a pharmakon, and we eated it.</p>

      <p>Pharmakon, φάρμακον, the Greek word that means both “poison” and “cure,” but, because of the limitations
        of the English language, can only be translated one way or the other depending on the context and the
        translator’s whims. No possible translation can capture the full implications of a Greek text including this
        word. In the <em>Phaedrus</em>, writing is the pharmakon that the trickster god Theuth offers, the toxin and
        remedy in one. With writing, man will no longer forget; but he will also no longer think. A double-edged
        (s)word, if you will. But the new iteration of the pharmakon is the meme. Specifically, the post-I-Can-Has
        memescape of 2007 onward. And it was the <em>language</em> that did it, Jane. The addition of <em>written
          language</em> twisted the remedy into a poison, flipped the pharmakon on its invisible axis.</p>

      <p>In retrospect, it was in front of our eyes all along. Meme. The noxious word was given to us by who else
        but those wily ancient Greeks themselves. μίμημα, or mīmēma. Defined as an imitation, a copy. The exact
        thing Plato warned us against in the <em>Republic</em>. Remember? The simulacrum that is two steps removed
        from the perfection of the original by the process of — note the root of the word — <em>mimesis</em>. The
        Platonic ideal of an object is the source: the father, the sun, the ghostly whole. The corporeal
        manifestation of the object is one step removed from perfection. The image of the object (be it in letters
        or in pigments) is two steps removed. The author is inferior to the craftsman is inferior to God.</p>

      <p>But we’ll go farther than Plato. Longcat, a photograph, is a textbook example of a second-degree mimesis.
        (We might promote it to the third degree since the image on the internet is a digital copy of the original
        photograph of the physical cat which is itself a copy of Platonic ideal of a cat (the Godcat, if you will);
        but this line of thought doesn’t change anything in the argument.) The text-supplemented meme, on the other
        hand, the captioned cat, is at an <em>infinite</em> remove from the Godcat; it is the ultimate mimesis,
        copying the copy of itself eternally, the written language and the image echoing off each other, until it
        finally loops back around to the truth by virtue of being so far from it. It becomes its own truth, the
        fidelity of the eternal copy. It becomes a God.</p>

      <p>Writing itself is the archetypical pharmakon <em>and</em> the archetypical copy, if you’ll come back with
        me to the <em>Phaedrus</em> (if we ever really left it). Speech is the real deal, Socrates says, with a smug
        little wink to his (written) dialogic buddy. Speech is alive, it can defend itself, it can adapt and change.
        Writing is its bastard son, the mimic, the dead, rigid simulacrum. Writing is a copy, a mīmēma, of truth in
        speech. To return to our analogous issue: the image of the cat that wants the cheezburger, the copy of the
        picture-copy-copy, is so much closer to its original Platonic ideal (Godcat) than the written language that
        accompanies it is to its own (speech). (“Pharmakon” can also mean “paint.” Think about it, Jane. Just think
        about it.) The image is still fake, but it’s the caption on the cat that is the downfall of the republic,
        the <em>real</em> fakeness, which is both realer and faker than whatever original it is that it
        represents.</p>

      <p>Men and gods abhor the lie, Plato says in sections 382 a and b of the <em>Republic</em>.</p>

      <p>“Don’t you know,” said I, “that the veritable lie, if the expression is permissible, is a thing that all
        gods and men abhor?” “What do you mean?” he said. “This,” said I, “that falsehood in the most vital part of
        themselves, and about their most vital concerns, is something that no one willingly accepts, but it is there
        above all that everyone fears it.”</p>

      <p>Man’s worst fear is that he will hold existential falsehood within himself. And the verbal lies that he
        tells are an incarnation of this fear; Plato elaborates: “the falsehood in words is a <em>copy</em> of the
        affection in the soul, an after-rising image of it and not an altogether unmixed falsehood.” A copy of man’s
        flawed internal copy of truth. And what word does Plato use for “copy” in this sentence? That’s fucking
        right, μίμημα. Mīmēma. Mimesis. Meme. The new meme is a lie, manifested in (written) words, that reflects
        the lack of truth, the emptiness, within the very soul of a human. The meme is now not only an inferior
        copy, it is a <em>deceptive</em> copy.</p>

      <p>But just wait, it gets better. Plato continues in the very next section of the <em>Republic</em>, 382 c.
        Sometimes, he says, the lie, the meme, is appropriate, even moral. It is not abhorrent to lie to your enemy,
        or to your friend in order to keep him from harm. “Does it [the lie] not then become useful to avert the
        evil—as a <em>medicine</em>?” You get one fucking guess for what Greek word is being translated as
        “medicine” here. Ding ding goddamn ding, you got it, φάρμακον, pharmakon. The μίμημα is a pharmakon, the lie
        is a medicine/poison, the meme is a pharmakon.</p>

      <p>But I’m sure that by now you’ve realized the (intentional) mistake in my argument that brought us to this
        point. I said earlier that the addition of written language to the meme flipped the pharmakon on its axis.
        But the pharmakon didn’t flip, it doesn’t have an axis. It was <em>always both</em> remedy and poison. The
        fact that this isn’t obvious to us from the very beginning of the discussion is the fault of, you guessed it,
        <em>language</em>. The initial lie (writing) clouds our vision and keeps us from realizing how false the
        second-order lie (the meme) is.
      </p>

      <p>The very structure of the lying meme mirrors the structure of the written word that defines and corrupts
        it. Once you try to identify an “outside” in order to reveal the lie, the whole framework turns itself
        inside-out so that you can never escape it. The cat wants the cheezburger that exists outside the meme, but
        only through the meme do we become aware of the presumed existence of the cheezburger—we can’t point out the
        absurdity of the world of the meme without also indicting our own world. We can’t talk about language without
        language, we can’t interpret memes without mimesis. Memes didn’t change between ’06 and ’07, it was us who
        changed. Or rather, our understanding of what we <em>had always been</em> changed. The lie became truth, the
        remedy became the poison, the outside became the inside. Which is to say that the truth became lie, the
        pharmakon was always the remedy and the poison, and the inside retreated further inside. It all came full
        circle. Because here’s the secret, Jane. Language ruined the meme, yes. But language itself had already been
        ruined. By that initial poisonous, lying copy. Writing. The First Pharmakon. The First Meme.</p>

      <p>Language didn’t attack the meme in 2007 out of spite. It attacked it to get revenge. Longcat is long.
        Language is language. Pharmakon is pharmakon. The phoneme topples the grapheme, witches ride through the
        night, our skulls hide secret messages on their surfaces, Smash Mouth is good after all. Hey now, you’re an
        all-star. Get your game on. Go play.</p>
