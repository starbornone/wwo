        <h2 class="chapter-title">Ancestor Offering</h2>
        <p>
          Prepare an offering of bread, honey, and mead for your ancestors. Place these on an altar or
          by a window where spirits may pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whisper your ancestors’ names, inviting them to visit and share in the meal. Allow the offering to remain
          overnight.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Spirit Lantern</h2>
        <p>
          Craft a lantern using a hollowed-out turnip or pumpkin. Place a candle inside and set the lantern at your
          doorstep or windowsill to guide spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you light the candle, say:
          <em>“Light the way for those who’ve come before, to find peace evermore.”</em>
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Apple Divination</h2>
        <p>
          To seek wisdom from the beyond, cut an apple in half horizontally, revealing the star within. Take a moment
          to focus on a question, then eat the apple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflect on any impressions or answers that come to mind as you finish the fruit.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Silent Vigil</h2>
        <p>
          At night, observe a silent vigil in a darkened room. Light a single candle and meditate on the
          ancestors who’ve passed on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the stillness, listen for messages or signs from those who have crossed over.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Graveyard Gathering</h2>
        <p>
          Visit a cemetery and leave small offerings of bread, herbs, or flowers on the graves of forgotten souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whisper words of peace and gratitude for those who rest, honoring the unremembered spirits.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Bonfire of Remembrance</h2>
        <p>
          Build a small, safe bonfire outdoors, using dried herbs like sage and juniper. Toss pieces of rosemary or
          thyme into
          the flames.
        </p>
        <p>
          As each piece burns, think of loved ones who have passed, honoring their memory with a moment of silence.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Spirit Pathway</h2>
        <p>
          Line your doorway or garden path with small stones, each representing a departed loved one. As you place
          each stone,
          quietly speak the person's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pathway is meant to guide the spirits as they visit, ensuring safe passage between worlds.
        </p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">Dream Talisman</h2>
        <p>
          Before sleep, place a sprig of mugwort or lavender under your pillow to invite dreams from the spirit world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you drift off, hold a question in mind, hoping for guidance from those beyond.
        </p>
